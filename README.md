<p>Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. It comprises about 20â€“25% of all sedimentary rocks. In this project, I have trained the Attention U-Net deep learning model for performing image segmentation of XRM (tomography) scan of a sandstone cylinder of size about 2 mm
diameter to identify the regions of clay, quartz, air, and pyrite. </p>
