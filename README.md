<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women, accounting for more than 1 in 10 new cancer diagnoses each year. It is the second most common cause of death from cancer among women in the world. In this project, I have developed the attention U-Net segmentation model that accurately segments the breast cancer-infected region from the breast ultrasound images. This model will significantly reduce radiologist time and fasten the process of breast cancer identification. </p>
